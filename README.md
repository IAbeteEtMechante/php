## Things to remember
When developping with apache (on ubuntu), put the files in /var/www/ 
by default the localhost port for Apache2 is 80
so you can look at it at http://localhost:80

and you can use :
`ngrok http 80
` to display it on the internet through ngok (once you have installed ngok on your machine!)
